# Machine learning submodule

This folder contains the code to train end evaluate the RASPD+ machine learning models

## Content

* `/src`
  * python modules that drive the model training and load and prepare the datasets
* `/notebooks`
  * `plot_results.ipynb`
    * makes all the figures for the analysis of the machine learning models seen in the paper and also provides additional information
  * `datastet_stats.ipynb`
    * analyzes the properties of our chosen descriptors on the PDBbind data set as well as the external test sets.
    * Also provides figures found in the paper
  * `*_external_benchmarks.csv` 
    * Benchmark results from other methods as seen in Jim√©nez et al. 2018
  * `verify_old_RASPD.ipynb`
    * read results data from the old RASPD approach (Mukherjee et al. 2011)
  * `dud_e_enrichment_assessment.ipynb`
    * Compute enrichment factors for evaluation on the Directory of useful Decoys - Enhanced (DUD-E) data set
  * `launch_runs.sh`
    * How to run the `train_and_eval.py` script to obtain the models used in `plot_results.ipynb`
* `pdbbind_descriptors.xlsx`
  * Precomputed RASPD+ descriptor values from the PDBbind refined set
* `dataset_smaller.txt`
  * small dataset from the PDBbind set for debugging
* `train_and_eval.py`
  * script to train new models and directly perform evaluation on selected datasets.
  * Modify source code to include additional hyperparameter options
* `eval_only.py`
  * Takes the result folder from a `train_and_eval.py` run and performs evaluation or feature importance analysis on additional datasets
  * output folders are consumed by the `plot_results` notebook
* `infer.py`
  * Script to predict binding free energies for a set of computed descriptors with an existing model.
  * Performs bagging by combining the results from cross-validation folds into one prediction
  
For information on how to run the three command line scripts, run them with the `--help` option.
