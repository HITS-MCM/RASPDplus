How to run this script:
bash job_run_customized.sh 1NHZ 486 erf
Here, 
1NHZ is the PDBid
486 is the Active_Site_Identifier of PDBid 1NHZ
erf is the Method used

Methods available for RASPD+ Screening: 
Extremely Random Forest (erf) 
Random Forest (rf) 
Deep Neural Network (dnn) 
k-Nearest neighbors (knn)
linear Support Vector Regression (svr) 
non-linear Epsilon Support Vector Regression (esvr) 
Linear Regression (lr)
A combinations of all the seven methods (all)
Using this script it is possible to screen customized small molecules dataset against a protein.
    Output files: 
    (i) FinalResult.txt (Contains molecule-id in first column and predicted binding free energies of the customized data set in second column)
    (ii) target.smi (Contains SMILE Code of the customized data set)
    Output file will be found inside the JobID folder to be created while running this script.

Using this script it is possible to screen an existing million molecule data set.
    Output files: 
    (i) FinalResult.txt (Contains molecule id in first column and predicted binding free energies of the million molecules in second column)
    (ii) target.smi (Contains SMILE Code of the million molecules)
Please note that, existing million molecule library was downloaded from ZINC v12 DATABASE (http://zinc12.docking.org/; Irwin, J. J.; Sterling, T.; Mysinger, M. M.; Bolstad, E. S.; Coleman, R. G. ZINC: A Free Tool to Discover Chemistry for Biology. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2012, 52, 1757-1768) from ChEMBL vendor and physicochemical parameters was calculated by using lig_parameters_gen.sh script
    Output file is there inside the JobID folder to be created while running this script.

#>  Script name: lig_parameters_gen.sh
/**
Author: Goutam Mukherjee
Purpose: Generate physicochemical parameters for customized small molecules. Parameters will be saved automatically in "$raspd_root/customized_data/" directory
Input file is *.txt file. Say, molecule.txt.
molecule.txt may contains one or more SMILES strings of ligand (drug-like) molecules
How to run:
bash lig_parameters_gen.sh molecule.txt (please note, file extension (*.txt) is mandatory)
This *.txt file MUST BE present at the current working directory where, the job will be executed by a script name "lig_parameters_gen.sh".

#>  Script name: scaffolds_search.sh
/**
Author: Goutam Mukherjee
Input information needed: (i) JobID, and (ii) user specified query scaffolds in a file named “scaffolds.txt”. 
Please note that “scaffolds.txt” file must be present where the script, "scaffolds_search.sh" is executed.
Purpose:
Scaffold search script will run after RASPD+. 
RASPD+ screen million or customized small molecule databases against a target protein and final output is a file (FinalResult.txt) which contains predicted binding free energies of these small molecules and SMILES codes for small molecules (target.smi).
These SMILES codes of samll molecule may contains several scaffolds/functional groups. If, one need to select a particular active scaffold from these databases, the SMILES code of this query active scaffolds  needs to  supply as a file name (scaffolds.txt). Please DON’T give file name other than scaffolds.txt.
 Say, for 3C protease of Hepatitis A Virus (HAV 3C), isatin (SMILE Code: C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C(=O)C(=O)N2) and its derivatives is found as an active inhibitor against this viral protein target (FEBS J. 2019, 286, 765-787; doi: 10.1111/febs.14707). Hence, after “RASPD+” screen of milion molecule database/customized small molecule databases against HAV 3C target protein, one could search these scaffolds from the “target.smi” file.
 This  “target.smi” file present inside the folder which was created by “RASPD+” while running the script, job_run_customized.sh. Therefore, this folder name (JobID) is required to provide as an input file. Since, inside this folder “target.smi” file exist and query active scaffold is searched from this target.smi file.
Command to run:
bash scaffolds_search.sh <JobID>
Say,
bash scaffolds_search.sh 24190489_million_1NHZ_486_all
This script may takes several minutes to hours depending on number of scaffolds present in the query file i.e.; in “scaffolds.txt” file.
Output files are: (i) target_scaffold.smi; (ii) target_scaffold_be.txt.
Output file can be found inside the "JobID" folder.

Author: Stefan Holderbach, HITS and Heidelberg University and Goutam Mukherjee, IIT Delhi and Heidelberg University and HITS
How to run:
bash single_molecule_scanning.sh <ligand.pdb> <Protein.pdb> <Identifier ID> <Method name>
Say, lgand.pdb = lig.pdb
     Protein.pdb = 1NHZ.pdb
     Identifier ID =  486
     Method(s) = erf, rf, dnn, knn, svr, esvr, lr and a combinations of all of these methods (all).   
bash single_molecule_scanning.sh lig.pdb 1NHZ.pdb 486 lr
or,
bash single_molecule_scanning.sh lig.pdb 1NHZ.pdb 486 erf

#>  Please note that input ligand size should be less than 300 atoms.
#>  Please note that all the input files MUST BE at the current working directory.
#>  All the jobs will be executed at this folder.
#>  Output file name is: FinalResult.txt
#>  Output file is there inside the JobID folder to be created while running this script.
