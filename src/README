/**To calculate the Wiener index of a molecule from a PDB file.
*WORKING:
*      1.Searches for lines starting with "ATOM" or "HETATM" to calculate the number of atom in molecule
*      2.Creates a graph with number of nodes = number of atoms.
*      3.Searches for lines starting with "CONECT" and then adds edges between relevant atoms using functions processline()  and addEdge().
*      4.Stores Bond Order between atoms in array bond[][];
*      5.Runs Dijkstra's algorithm to establish shortest path between atoms and stores this information in array windex[][]
*      6.Calculates and prints the Wiener index

*USAGE : Usage: ./windex_list.exe <PDB file>
*WARNINGS: Program takes a specific format of PDB file, example file appended at the end
*DEPENDENCIES:PDB file output from Connect2.0.exe programme
